# Ray-Tracing-Proj1
Basic forward ray tracing algorithm used on a spherical plane (matplotlib, numpy).

specific.py :
- asks for ray separation distance, the smaller the more accurate
- asks for radius length (of the sphere)
- calculates the area of impact from the rays hitting the sphere (total white pixels)
